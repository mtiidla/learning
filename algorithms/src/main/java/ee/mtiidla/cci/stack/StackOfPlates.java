    // 3.3 Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in
    // real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceed some threshold.
    // Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed
    // of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceed capacity.
    // SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that
    // is, pop() should return the same value as it would if there were just a single stack)

    // FOLLOW UP
    // Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
    // Hints #98, #114
